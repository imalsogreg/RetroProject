	this is the name of any datafile which is generated by the
	the suite of UNIX analysis/extraction programs.

	DEFAULT: none. Required argument.

OUTPUT FILE OPTIONS:
    -o file
	Specifies the file to which the resulting output will be sent.

	DEFAULT: not verbose

NOTES:
    The exit status of 'header' can be used to determine whether or not
    a file header was found and, therefore, provides a means for determining
    whether or not the target file was formatted for the analysis/extraction
    suite of programs.
    An exit status of 0 indicates success in reading the header.
    An exit status of 1 indicates failure in reading the header.
