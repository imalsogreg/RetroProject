	The contents of the file beyond the header will remain unchanged.

	DEFAULT: none. Required argument.

	Specifies the file to which the edited original will be saved.
	If not specified, the original input file will be replaced
	following a final user prompt for verification.

    -v
	this option turns on verbose mode which will display more extensive
	status information during data processing.

NOTES:
    The editor used for editing the header can be specified by setting the
    EDITOR environment variable. If this variable is not set then the 'vi'
    editor is used by default.
    If a file which does not have a header is edited, the user will be prompted
    for verification.
    If the temporary file containing the header being edited is not changed
    the editing session will be aborted and no output will be generated.
    The temporary files used to hold copies of the original data file
    are made in the /tmp area. Large data files may exceed the capacity of
    /tmp. If this occurs the TMPDIR environment can be set to the path 
    of a directory used to hold these temporary files.
