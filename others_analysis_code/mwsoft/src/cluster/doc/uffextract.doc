USAGE:
    uffextract uff_file [-ufftype #] [-subfield n # # ..]
	[-s] [-t] [-tq] [-p] [-c] [-se] [-ef] [-header]
	[-startflag str] [-endflag str] [-startsubflag str] [-endsubflag str] 
	[-probe #] [-o file] [-v]

OPTIONS:
    Note that spaces between options and arguments are important.
    Order of the arguments is not important. All arguments and options
    must be placed on a single line (no carriage returns).

INPUT FILE OPTIONS:
    uff_file
	this is the name of a sun-converted Brainwave(tm) uff file.
	The conversion from PC format to SUN format must be done
	with the 'convert' program.

	DEFAULT: none. Required argument.


OUTPUT FILE OPTIONS:
    -o file
	Specifies the file to which the output will be saved. 

	DEFAULT: output to stdout (the terminal).

EXTRACTION OPTIONS:
    These options specify the type of extraction to be performed.
    Each are mutually exclusive.

    -s
	specifies extraction of 'stereotrode waveform' or 'S' records.  
	The resulting binary file is contains records consisting of
	timestamp and waveform fields for all steretrode spikes in the uff file.

	DEFAULT: true

    -t
	specifies extraction of 'tetrode waveform' or 'U' records.  
	The resulting binary file is contains records consisting of
	timestamp and waveform fields for all tetrode spikes in the uff file.

	DEFAULT: false

    -c
	specifies extraction of 'cluster id' or 'S' records.  
	The resulting binary file is contains records consisting of
	timestamp and clusterid fields for all stereotrode spike records
	in the uff file.

	DEFAULT: false

    -tq
	specifies extraction of 'tetrode waveform' or 'Q' records. For
	backward compatibility only.

	DEFAULT: false

    -p
	specifies extraction of 'dual diode position' or 'P' records.  
	The resulting binary file is contains records consisting of
	timestamp and x1 y1 x2 y2 fields for all position samples
	in the uff file.

	DEFAULT: false

    -se
	specifies extraction of 'single electrode probe/cluster id' or 
	'E' records.  The resulting binary file is contains records 
	consisting of probe#, timestamp and clusterid fields for all 
	single electrode spikes in the uff file.

	DEFAULT: false

    -ef
	specifies extraction of 'event flags' or 'B' records.  
	The resulting binary file is contains records consisting of
	timestamp and flagvalue fields for all event flags 
	in the uff file.

	DEFAULT: false

    -ufftype #
	specifies extraction of record types which match the specified
	argument. This option must be used in conjunction with the
	-subfield option.

	DEFAULT: none

    -subfield n # # ...
	This option is used in conjection with the -ufftype option and
	specifies the field numbers which will be extracted from the
	record types defined by the -ufftype option. The 'n' argument
	indicates the number of fields to be extracted for each record
	and the subsequent numbers indicate the field numbers within
	that record to be extracted.

	DEFAULT: none
	

EXTRACTION MODIFIER OPTIONS:
    -probe #
	restricts extraction to those records which contain the appropriate
	probe number. 

	DEFAULT: all probes

    -startflag str
	restricts extraction to those records which follow the event flag
	given by the 'str' argument.

	DEFAULT: none

    -endflag str
	restricts extraction to those records which precede the event flag
	given by the 'str' argument. All processing stops after reaching
	this flag.

	DEFAULT: none

    -startsubflag str
	restricts extraction to those records which follow the event flag
	given by the 'str' argument. This allows extraction of nested
	flags.

	DEFAULT: none

    -endsubflag str
	restricts extraction to those records which precede the event flag
	given by the 'str' argument. In contrast to the -endflag option,
	processing continues after reaching this subflag, allowing 
	extraction of multiple nested subflags.

	DEFAULT: none

MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS:
    -usage
	displays the list of available options.

    -v
	this option turns on verbose mode which will display more extensive
	status information during data processing.

	DEFAULT: not verbose

    -header
	this option causes the header of the uff file to be displayed
	without any extraction taking place. If this option is specified
	all other options will be ignored.

	DEFAULT: false

NOTES:
    To create a sun-compatible uff file starting with a PC formatted
    uff file, use the following command

	convert file

    where file is the name of the PC formatted uff file. This will
    automatically create a file by the same name with the '.sun' extension
    appended to it. The original is left intact following conversion
    and can be removed if desired.

    When event flags are used to restrict extraction to certain portions
    of the data file, it is assumed that the file is is proper timestamp
    order. Therefore extraction begins and stops based on the file position
    marked by the event flag and not its timestamp.

EXAMPLES:

    Given the uff file 'data.cut.sun' which contains manually clustered
    stereotrode spike data, cluster id information which is used by
    the behavioral and interval analysis programs 'behav' and 'isi' can
    be extracted with the following command:

	uffextract data.cut.sun -c -o data.cid

    If multiple probes are present in the same file, the extraction can
    be restricted to data from probe 1 with the command:

	uffextract data.cut.sun -c -probe 1 -o data1.cid

    Event flags can be extracted from the same file using the command:

	uffextract data.cut.sun -ef -o data.ef
