USAGE:
    efextract effile [-o file] [-to tfile] 
	[-ef str [-ef str] ...] [-show] [-v]

OPTIONS:
    Note that spaces between options and arguments are important.
    Order of the arguments is not important. All arguments and options
    must be placed on a single line (no carriage returns).

INPUT FILE OPTIONS:
    effile
	this is a binary formatted file which is generated by the
	the uffextract program and contains timestamp and eventflag
	information.

	DEFAULT: none. Required argument.

OUTPUT FILE OPTIONS:
    -o file
	Specifies the file to which ascii event flag information will be saved
	when the -show option is selected.
	The format of the ascii file is the event flag string followed by
	its timestamp.

	DEFAULT: output to stdout (the terminal) when -show is specified.

    -to tfile
	Specifies the file to which timestamp information will be saved. 
	This is a binary file containing the timestamps of selected events.
	This file is used as input to several of the analysis programs
	such as 'isi' and 'behav'.

	DEFAULT: no output

EXTRACTION OPTIONS:
    -ef str #
	specifies the event flag string which is to be extracted from the
	effile. This option can be specified multiple times for multiple
	event flags.

	DEFAULT: none

    -show
	produces an ascii output of eventflags and their timestamps. 
	This option will supress any other selected output (see -to).

	DEFAULT: false

MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS:
    -usage
	displays the list of available options.

    -version
	displays the version number of the program

    -v
	this option turns on verbose mode which will display more extensive
	status information during data processing.

	DEFAULT: not verbose

NOTES:

EXAMPLES:
    Given the ef file 'data.ef', a tfile for event flags MW and AZ, which 
    is used by the behavioral and interval analysis programs 'behav' and 
    'isi', can be extracted with the following command:

	efextract data.ef -to tevent1 -ef MW -ef AZ
