USAGE:
    cidextract cidfile [-o ifile] [-no] [-to tfile] 
	[-cluster #] [-count] [-show] [-v]

OPTIONS:
    Note that spaces between options and arguments are important.
    Order of the arguments is not important. All arguments and options
    must be placed on a single line (no carriage returns).

INPUT FILE OPTIONS:
    cidfile
	this is a binary formatted file which is generated by the
	the uffextract program and contains timestamp and clusterid
	information.

	DEFAULT: none. Required argument.

OUTPUT FILE OPTIONS:
    -o file
	Specifies the file to which spike index information will be saved. 
	This is an ascii file containing the indices of spikes contained
	in the selected cluster.

	DEFAULT: output to stdout (the terminal).

    -to tfile
	Specifies the file to which timestamp information will be saved. 
	This is a binary file containing the timestamps of spikes contained
	in the selected cluster.
	This file is used as input to several of the analysis programs
	such as 'isi' and 'behav'.

	DEFAULT: no output

    -no 
	supresses output of the spike index information (see -o option)

	DEFAULT: no supression

EXTRACTION OPTIONS:
    -cluster #
	specifies the cluster number which is to be extracted from the
	cidfile.

	DEFAULT: none

    -count
	causes the program to display the total number of clusters 
	present in the cidfile.

	DEFAULT: false

    -show
	produces a raw output of cluster ids in the file. This option
	will supress any other selected output (see -o -to).

	DEFAULT: false

MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS:
    -usage
	displays the list of available options.

    -version
	displays the version number of the program

    -v
	this option turns on verbose mode which will display more extensive
	status information during data processing.

	DEFAULT: not verbose

NOTES:

EXAMPLES:
    Given the cid file 'data.cid', a tfile for cluster 1, which is used by 
    the behavioral and interval analysis programs 'behav' and 'isi', can 
    be extracted with the following command:

	cidextract data.cid -to tdata1 -no -cluster 1
