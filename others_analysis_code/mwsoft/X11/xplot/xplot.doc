usage: xplot file [file ..][options]
    Available options:
	-usage			displays available command line options
	-version		displays current version number
	-title str		sets the graph title to 'str'
	-bw			sets monochrome display mode
	-inverse		inverts white and black
	-font name		uses specified font for text
	-nomap			dont create an X window (for printing only)
	-geometry str		create the graph window with the given geometry
	-xtitle name		label the x axis
	-ytitle name		label the y axis
	-command str		execute the given command string after loading
				the plot file
	-commandfile file	execute the commands in the given file after
				loading the plot file 

XPLOT takes data in the form of one or more ascii files 
each containing lists of coordinate values with single coordinate
pairs and an optional error bar or z value on each line.
Comments can be added by placing a % at the beginning of the line.
These lines will be ignored during processing.
XPLOT can also be used as a filter, taking input from the standard input.
The data files have this general format

    % comment
    % comment
    /command
    x		y	[error]
    x1		y1	[error1]
    ...
    % comment
    /command

For example
    %
    % data file with error bars
    % x axis is time, y axis is amplitude
    %
    0		5.3	10
    1		2.2	3.4

or
    %
    % data file without error bars
    % x axis is time, y axis is amplitude
    %
    0		5.3
    1		2.2

The following xplot commands can also be placed in data files
one per line with no leading white space:

While in XPLOT, entering key strokes in the plot window will cause
various actions to take place. Many commands take numeric arguments
which are entered by typing the appropriate
value in the plot window prior to entering the action keystroke.

For example, to place the x axis at the y intercept of 10 you
would type in the plot window

    10 x | 		[without spaces and without carriage return]

to change it to -57.4 

    -57.4 |		[note that the x axis has already been selected
			 and does not need to be respecified ]

to place the y axis at the x intercept of 0 

    y 0 | 		[note that the y can be performed any time prior to |]

to display the data as a bar graph instead of a line plot

    1 <esc> m

to autoscale the window to display all the data (useful following zooms and
pans)
