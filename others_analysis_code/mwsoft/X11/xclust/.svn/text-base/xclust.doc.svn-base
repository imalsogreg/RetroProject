usage: xplot file [file ..][-title name][-usage]
	[-bw][-inverse][-font name]
	[-xlh # #][-ylh # #]
	[-xtitle name][-ytitle name]
	[-command str][-commandfile name]

XPLOT takes data in the form of one or more ascii files 
each containing lists of coordinate values with single coordinate
pairs and an optional error bar value on each line.
A command string
Comments can be added by placing a % at the beginning of the line.

    % comment
    x		y	[error]
    x1		y1	[error1]
    ...

For example
    %
    % data file with error bars
    % x axis is time, y axis is amplitude
    %
    0		5.3	10
    1		2.2	3.4

or
    %
    % data file without error bars
    % x axis is time, y axis is amplitude
    %
    0		5.3
    1		2.2

The following xplot commands can also be placed in data files

    3	4.7

    /geometry 100x300+10+20
    /setenv PRINTER myprinter
    /print


While in XPLOT, entering key actions in the plot window will cause
various actions to take place. Many commands take numeric arguments
which are entered by typing the appropriate
value in the plot window.

			Key/button actions 
			---------------------

Buttons
-------

left		drag a zoom region
middle		display the world coordinates of the current cursor location
middle-drag	sweep a line between the click point and the release point
right		display the world coordinates of the nearest point on the
		currently selected plot

<esc> refers to the escape key
<int> refers to any integer 
<float> refers to any floating point number
^ refers to the control character

For example, to place the x axis at the y intercept of 10 you
would type in the plot window

    10 x | 		[without spaces and without carriage return]

to change it to -57.4 

    -57.4 |		[note that the x axis has already been selected
			 and does not need to be respecified ]

to place the y axis at the x intercept of 0 

    y 0 | 		[note that the y can be performed any time prior to |]

to display the data as a bar graph instead of a line plot

    1 <esc> m

to autoscale the window to display all the data (useful following zooms and
pans)
