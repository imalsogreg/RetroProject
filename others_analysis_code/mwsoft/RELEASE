RELEASE NOTES FOR MWL-WILSON-SOFTWARE RPM

Tom Davidson and Fabian Kloosterman
Original code written by Matt Wilson

RPM version minor number changes when features are added. Release number
changes indicate bug-fix releases.

====================
Version: 1.2
Release: 1
Date:    18 February 2005

 -See Wiki documentation for explanation of new xclust UI stuff. If the
  answer isn't there, then add it to the Wiki!

 -See TODO for comprehensive list of features and bug-fixes; see
  ChangeLog for file-by-file changes.

Summary: 

-Release of xclust3 (codename fkloost), which will become the active
development branch for xclust. Xclust2 is included, but with no
changes from rpm version 1.1-2 (xclust version 3.2).

-Added support for clustering without access to spike (.tt) files and for
clustering on parm (.pxyabw) files which only contain a subset of the
spike records from a spike file. (changes to xclust and findspike)

-Added support for an 'epoch file', so that epoch start/end info
doesn't have to be stored in the .xclustrc file.

-xclust UI changes and additional visualizations, including
interactive 3-D rotation of cluster points.

Changes:

findspike (1.07):
-now accepts parm (.pxyabw) files as well as spike (.tt) files.
-now returns closest spike to requested time, rather than the next
 earliest spike
-only returns special '-1' error result when asked for spike or index
'-1', not for all out of range requests.
-returns different error codes for different failure modes

xclust3 (xclust 3.3):
-supports clustering without access to spike (.tt) files.
-supports clustering on parm files that contain only a subset of spike
records from a .tt file ('degenerate' parm files), as long as the parm
file is BINARY, and contains a 'time' or 'timestamp' field.
-config file is called .xclust3rc, not .xclustrc .
-collapsible menus for use on small screens
-interactive 3-D rotation of cluster points (ctrl-left click)
-remapping of functions to extra mouse buttons (see Wiki!)
-'blockmovie' for panning through points; replaying behavior
-new projection selection/randomization grid (select Z proj)
-cluster scores (1-5) written out to cbfile and cl-files
-cluster bound editing
-file status in menu with time/id of loaded points
-many bugs/segfaults fixed


-minor bugfixes
  -many...

Across all apps:

  -'-version' message now reports compile time and RPM by which they
   were provided.

====================
Version: 1.1
Release: 2
Date:    29 November 2004

Summary:

The last release (1.1-1) broke behav, including calls from
xclust2. This release fixes it.

Changes:

behav (2.31)

A bug in behav was introduced by Tom in the last version. The bug
caused behav to fail when it wasn't called with the -ro and -fo (rate
and position output file) options. In particular this broke the behav
calls from xclust2.


====================
Version: 1.1
Release: 1
Date:    22 November 2004

Summary:

The original sources have been cleaned and put into a CVS
repository. From now on, the software will be distributed as a single
RPM package, instead of multiple packages. There is now a top-level
Makefile that can compile all code and generate the RPM for
distribution (just checkout and call 'make rpm'). Several bugs have
been fixed, many compiler warnings have been solved, and obsolete code
has been removed.

For a detailed list of changes see ChangeLog.

Major changes:

Across all apps:
    Headers now include a '% Program Version:' field, which indicates
    the version of the binary used to generate the file.

    We no longer install any shared libs, since all code was
    statically linked, anyways.

adextract (1.17)

    FIX: the command line argument -eslen80 now works correctly. By default
    adextract will extract 80 character long event strings, unless -eslen40 is
    passed as an argument

csi (1.03)

    FIX: changed max_interval and min_interval variables to doubles
    (from floats) for higher precision complex spike index
    calculation.

esextract (1.07)

    ADD: command line arguments -eslen40 and -eslen80 for selection os event string
    lengths (default = 80)

posextract (1.22)

    FIX: the -switchfb option didn't do anything. Now using this
    option will cause the program to generate an error and exit

spikeanal (1.28)

    FIX: Empty t-files are now correctly handled in -isi mode

spikeavg (1.28)

    CHANGE: default vertical offset (used if the -spkvoffset argument is not provided)
    is now 0 (was 2048)

spikeparms2 (1.7)

    default vertical offset (used if the -voffset argument is not provided)
    is now 0 (was 2048)

textract (1.01)

    FIX: the combination of -singlespike mode and an ASCII input file will no longer segfault

xclust2 (3.2)

    FIX: csi calculation now using higher precision variables
    (doubles).

    FIX: (partially) fixed invisible spike average plot. now always
    plotted in white (clust_menu.c)

    FIX: cross correlation with cluster 9 now possible (clust_menu.c)

    REMOVED: simacquire command (commands.c)

    REMOVED: support for digitizing pad input (commands.c, digitize.c,
    event_loop.c, main.c, menu.c, xclust_struct.h)

    FIX: fixed plotcompare function that is used by Sort(), which is
    used as part of calculating CSI (graph.c)

    FIX: The step values next to the spike viewer buttons are now visible

    CHANGE: the meaning of the tmax and bin parameters have changed in case
    of the LogISI function. tmax now specifies the maximal isi in msec (was 10^tmax).
    The actual max isi is the log(tmax), rounded down to an integer. The bin parameter
    will now specify the size (in mses) of the middle most bin.
