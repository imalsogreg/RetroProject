ToDo:

# Awake Up/Down similar to sleep Up/Down

## What things to look at?

  * Up-state length distrubution/ down-state length distribution
  * LFP frequency content to separate blocky from chattery frames
  * Blocky vs. chattery frame Thalamus correlates?
  * Sleep scoring - can we distninguish Type I / Type II?


# Stuart-style ripple stuff

## Ripple-triggered:

  * MUA/LFP in HPC/RSC/ADThal
  * Split by wake/sleep
  * Split by single/double/tripple

## Dip-triggered:

  * MUA/LFP in HPC/RSC/ADThal
  * Split by wake/sleep
  * Split by single/double/tripple


# Traveling wave

 ## CA3 info content is synchronized with CA1??
 ## Redo pairwise xcorr analysis, but accounting for changing wave parameters.
