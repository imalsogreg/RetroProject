Read Norman Ramsey's paper about expectations from students in his lab.  Interesting part about how grad school is a business - PI needs to meet contractual obligations but has no time to do so him/herself, so hires RA's.  The point isn't that the system is bad though - the point is that an RA has to recognize their quasi-business-partner role and do a good job at it.

Working on Documents/Papers/TravelingWave Figure1 and Figure2 sketches.
Decided to split Figure 1 into 3 or 4 figs after talking to Matt yesterday.  LFP and MUA get separate figures for sure.

Read most of Simon Marlow's book chapter on STM.  Pretty exciting stuff!

Ran Blue the rat with Hector.  Tons of cells on the track, and reasonable multi-unit in retrosplenial cortex.  Hector told me a couple days ago: ripples that happen alongside wake slow waves are much more likely to be reverse-replay events than ripples not accompanied by wake slow waves.
