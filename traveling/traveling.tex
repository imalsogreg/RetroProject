\section*{Abstract}
Brain areas involved in mnemonic and spatial processing are locked to the common underlying theta (8-12 Hz) oscillation.  However, the various subregions of hippocampus, the different layers of entorhinal cortex, and subcortical areas are each maximally activated during different theta phases.  And within hippocampal layer CA1, theta phase preferences are offset in a gradient manner.  Theta not only paces neural excitability; it influences spatial information encoding by organizing the timing of place cell ensembles into temporally precise sequences.  Using multi-site tetrode arrays, we sought to determine the impact of theta timing offsets on the unity of spatial representations.  We show that spatial information content within CA1 is synchronized, and that CA3 information content is synchronized with that in CA1, despite theta phase offsets that would predict timing offsets of up to 30 ms.  Rather that desynchronizing representations, these theta offsets modulate the phase of sequence encoding at which the respective areas are most active.  This finding is at odds with prior models strictly linking theta phase to place cell spike timing. Adding a baseline excitatory drive to each area according to that area's phase offset brings the population information into synchrony and accounts for anatomical gradations in spatial receptive field shape.  These results show that fine-timescale information coding can be decoupled from underlying differences in timing of excitatory drive.

\section*{Author Summary}
Theta oscillations have a local role assembling spatial information in individual brain structures, and a global role in coordinating activity between those structures.  But theta oscillations aren't synchronized across brain structures - different structures phase lock to different phases, and within the hippocampal region CA1, there is a continuous gradient of phase offsets.  Litte is known about how information movees from area to area in the hippocampus, but precise theta timing is known to have an important role.  Therefore a first step in understanding information flow is to assess whether these timing offsets in peak excitation are manifest as timing offsets in information representation.  By recording ensembles of neurons simultaneously throughout hippocampal CA1 and in CA3, we directly measured the level of excitation synchrony and information content synchrony.  We found that fine-timescale information content is measurably less than that of the offsets in theta, and not measurably different from 0.  Modifying a simple model of the interaction between neural encoding and theta oscillations by supplying each brain area with a baseline excitation change that cancels out the predicted effect of theta time offsets brings expecting information content back into synchrony (by definition), while accounting for previously documented differences in the tuning properties of individual neurons.  Information content is decoupled from offsets in underlying excitation in a way that preserves information synchrony, while allowing different brain areas to be preferrentially active during different phases of encoding.

\section*{Introduction}
Rhythmic modulation of neural firing is ubiquitous in the brain structures that underly mnemonic and spatial processes: the medial entorhinal cortex, the subiculum, anterior thalamic nuclei, retrosplenial cortex, and the various layers of the hippocampus.  Theta (8-12 Hz) oscillations have a global role, coordinating activity between connected brain regions; and they have a local role, shaping the fine-timescale properties of information coding within brain areas.
