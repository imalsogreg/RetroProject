\section*{Abstract}
Brain areas involved in mnemonic and spatial processing are locked to an underlying 8-12 Hz oscillation known as the theta rhythm.  Different layers of entorhinal cortex, subcortical areas, and hippocampal subfields are each maximally activated during different theta phases; even within field CA1, theta-locked excitation is offset in a gradient manner.  In addition to pacing cell excitability, theta influences spatial information processing by organizing the timing of place cell ensembles into temporally precise sequences. We sought to determine the impact of theta timing offsets on the coordination of spatial representations in ensembles of place cells across brain areas.

Along the CA1 septal-temporal axis, and between CA1 and CA3, we found spatial information content to be synchronized to within 5 ms, despite a time offset in theta on the order of 30 ms. Offsets in excitability manifest as a subtle tendency for different brain areas to be more active at different phases of the theta cycle, but this is independent of the encoded spatial information. The same degree of inter-area synchrony is apparent in the hippocampus of stationary rats, which sporadically replays sequences of spatial locations.

This observed information synchrony in the context of desynchronized excitation provides a constraint for future models of fast-timescale space coding. For instance, our prior excitation-to-phase model predicts desynchronized spatial information, but bringing it into alignment with our new data through compensatory inhibition preduces a pattern of single-cell spatial tuning that has 
Integrating these findings into a model of theta phase encoding can accoun for previous observations of diverse It also has implications for the integration of spatial signals in downstream structures, which may be befuddled by anything short of a coherent message from converging inputs.

This finding is at odds with prior models that strictly link theta phase to place cell spike timing. Adding a baseline excitatory drive to each area according to that area's phase offset brings the population information into synchrony and accounts for anatomical gradations in spatial receptive field shape.  These results show that fine-timescale information coding can be decoupled from underlying differences in timing of excitatory drive.

\section*{Author Summary}
Theta oscillations have a local role assembling spatial information in individual brain structures, and a global role in coordinating activity between those structures.  But theta oscillations aren't synchronized across brain structures - different structures phase lock to different phases, and within the hippocampal region CA1, there is a continuous gradient of phase offsets.  Litte is known about how information movees from area to area in the hippocampus, but precise theta timing is known to have an important role.  Therefore a first step in understanding information flow is to assess whether these timing offsets in peak excitation are manifest as timing offsets in information representation.  By recording ensembles of neurons simultaneously throughout hippocampal CA1 and in CA3, we directly measured the level of excitation synchrony and information content synchrony.  We found that fine-timescale information content is measurably less than that of the offsets in theta, and not measurably different from 0.  Modifying a simple model of the interaction between neural encoding and theta oscillations by supplying each brain area with a baseline excitation change that cancels out the predicted effect of theta time offsets brings expecting information content back into synchrony (by definition), while accounting for previously documented differences in the tuning properties of individual neurons.  Information content is decoupled from offsets in underlying excitation in a way that preserves information synchrony, while allowing different brain areas to be preferrentially active during different phases of encoding.

\section*{Introduction}
Rhythmic modulation of neural firing is ubiquitous in the brain structures that underly mnemonic and spatial processes: the medial entorhinal cortex, the subiculum, anterior thalamic nuclei, retrosplenial cortex, and the various layers of the hippocampus \cite{vanderwolf1969hippocampal, buzsaki2002theta}.  Theta (8-12 Hz) oscillations have play an important role at two levels. On the global level they coordinate activity between connected brain regions \cite{Siapas2006, Jones2006, Serota2010, Colgin2011}. Locally they shape the fine-timescale properties of information coding within brain areas \cite{Recce1993,Skaggs1996,Mehta2002,Leutgeb2010}.


Unifying these two roles for theta oscillations is difficult, because they make conflicting demands on the details of how neurons interact with the oscillation.  Mizuseki et. al. \cite{Mizuseki2009} point out that time offsets theta oscillations across brain regions fail to match the sequence  of time offsets predicted by monosynaptic delays between connected areas.  For example, pikes should only take 10ms TODO_CHECK to move from entorhinal cortext to the dentage gyrus, but the peak activation times of these two areas differs by about 97 ms (over half of a theta cycle).  This phenomenon is acceptable to the global account of theta; it allows for the opening of 'temporal windows' of processing between sequential anatomical processing stages.  But it is at odds with intuitive and formal models of the fine timescale spiking of place cells TODO_CITE.  Place cells in dentate gyrus are generated from the summed spiking activity of their inputs, and are expected to follow the timing of their inputs closely TODO_CITE.

Colgin et. al. present data in support of a model associating particular phases of the theta oscillations of CA1 with the opening of specific communication channels to either CA3 or the entorhinal cortex \cite{Colgin2009}.  The tension between theta's local and global roles is apparent here, too.  Local effects on
