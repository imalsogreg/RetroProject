## Synchronized Spatial Content in the Context of Theta Timing Offsets

## Abstract

## Intro

 * Spatial content has precise timing (phase precession, replay)
 * Traveling theta adds timing offsets to spikes
 * Different structures (CA1,CA3) also have offset theta phases
 * Is spatial content offset with phase offsets?

## Materials

 * Standard Wilson-lab drives and recording
 * Tetrodes arranged in a lattice
 * Arte large-scale recording
 * Dragoi-style pos-phase regression
 * Position reconstruction

## Results

 * Average traveling wave parameters, some timecourses, during RUN
 * Similar plot for CA3?
 *
