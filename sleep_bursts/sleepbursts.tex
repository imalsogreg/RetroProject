\section*{Abstract}
Hippocampal ripples lack the marked regularity of theta waves.  Previous reports describe the timing of ripples as a Poisson process, perhaps with a mild tendency for some ripples to occur in quick succession (bursts).  The recent finding that sequential replay of spatial information content in the hippocampus can span multiple ripple events prompted a reexamination of this timing, because ripple bursts may be involved in the generation of extended replay or its transmission to the rest of the brain.
By using large tetrode arrays and focusing on ripples that happen in short time windows, we report a higher level of ripple rhythmicity than was previously recognized.  Ripples that form bursts (by falling within a quarter second of any other ripple) tend to be separated by 70-100 milliseconds.  Additionally, ripple bursts accompany tightly time-locked modulation of the retrosplenial cortex.
Paradoxically, while the longest observed bouts of sequence replay are found while rats are still awake, the rhythmic organization of ripples within bursts is limited to slow-wave sleep.  Ripple bursts in the waking rat are less frequent than in the sleeping rat.  Ripples during wake and sleep have opposing effects on the retrosplenial cortex - activating it during wake and inhibiting it during sleep.
These findings raise new questions about the mechanisms of ripple generation and the effects of ripples on cortical targets.  Plausible of ripple initiation and cortical response should predict differential effects between waking activity and slow wave sleep.
