\section*{Abstract}
Observational descriptions of hippocampal spatial encoding are outpacing our understanding of their underlying mechanisms and ties to behavior. The traditoinal manipulation techniques can not adequately target the richly choreographed spiking sequences increasingly recognized as an essential feature of spatial encoding. Some disruption specificity can be achieved by leveraging known statistical relationships between information content and the recency of spatial experience, and such experiments have provided the first evidence of a link between sequence replay and learning.  But this method stops short of being able to distinguish among the diverse forms of spatial content known to be expressed in a single recording session.

A method of decoding spatial information content in real-time is needed. To do this, we are developing a multi-tetrode recording system focused on streaming representations of the processing stages typically used for offline spatial decoding: spike detection, neural source separation (cluster-cutting), position tracking, tuning curve extraction, and Bayesian stimulus reconstruction.  Our implementation makes critical use of Haskell, a programming language that aides software development by strictly separating a program's logic from its effects on program state, greatly simplifying code and eliminating large classes of common software bugs.  We describe the capabilities and limits of our recording system, its implementation, and routes for contributers to add functionality; and we survey the classes of questions that could benefit from real-time stimulus reconstruction and feedback.

\section*{Author Summary}
We report a working, open-source neural recordign system, and a proof-of-concept real-time signal decoding algorithm suitable for interpreting neural activity in rats navigating in mazes. We currently use the system to increase the number of neurons we can simultaneously record from. We intend to integrate the new algorithm in order to feed the information content of the navigating rat's brain back into the experiment, for example, by immediately rewarding the rat for exhibiting brain activity hypothesized to reflect memory formation for specific recently-learned events.

\section*{Introduction}
Temporally compressed spike sequences are increasingly recognized as an essential feature of hippocampal encoding of space. Each increase in our ability to sample large numbers of cells in freely navigating rats has been accompanied by further support this claim \cite{wilson1993dynamics, miller2008all}.

Physiologists are aware of two forms of sequential encoding. The first occurs during active navigation. The majority \cite{thompson1989place} of spiking activity in the hippocampus is due to place cells \cite{okeefe1971the}, which spike only when the rat is within an approximately 1 meter span of the track particular to that place cell (the cell's ``place field''). At any given time, the rat is within the partially overlapping place fields of many place cells. Rather than fire in random order, the spikes are arranged in precise sequences, with spikes from cells with place fields centered just behind the rat first, spikes from place fields centered ahead of the rat last, and a continuum between \cite{skaggs1996theta}. This sequence reflects the sequences of place field centers that the rat would encounter on the track, except it is sped up eight times and repeated once per cycle of the underlying 7-10 Hz ``theta'' oscillation in the local field potential \cite{dragoi2006temporal, foster2007hippocampal}. 

A second form of sequenced spiking occurs while rats are paused on the track, consuming rewards or grooming. At these times, the hippocampus emits irregular, 100-500 ms bursts of local field potential ``sharp wave-ripples''(SW-R's) and spiking activity, with spikes ordered in time according to the spatial ordering of their respective place fields \cite{foster2006reverse, diba2007forward}. These are known as 'sequence replay' events. Sequence replay often represents a track other than the track that the rat is currently running on \cite{karlsson2009awake}; indeed it was first observed in sleeping rats \cite{lee2002memory}.

In contrast to the large number of studies exploring the phenomenology of theta sequences and sequence replay \cite{davidson2009hippocampal,gupta2012segmentation,karlsson2009awake,pfeiffer2013hippocampal,cei2014hippocampal}, interventional studies are rare, because any specific activity pattern of interest is embedded in a network also exhibiting off-target sequences, and sequences themselves are not apparent to the experimenter without extensive post-processing. 

The content of sequence replay has a tendency to reflect recent experience, however. Some investigators using SW-R's as a trigger for immediate activity disruption have taken advantage of this to achieve some degree of stimulus selectivity in replay disruption. Ego-Stengel and Wilson \cite{ego2010disruption} and Girardeau et. al. \cite{girardeau2009selective} used this paradigm to show that selective disruption of sleep sequence replay of one track can delay the acquisition of a spatial task on that track, relative to another track. And Jadhav et. al. \cite{jadhav2012awake} disrupted all awake sequence replay and showed that this impacts working memory performance.

We would like to ask much more specific questions of sequence replay than whether or not it is needed for learning, of course. Does an individual replay reflect active cognitive processing of a route? Does a single theta sequence reflect a single conginitve sampling of a path ahead that may or may not lead to reward? Answering these questions means performing in realtime all of the processing steps from raw signal acquisition and sequence replay detection.

Here we report on two advances toward this goal. The first is a new system for simple acquisition, bandpass filtering, and multi-unit spike detection capable of running in tandem with our existing recording systems. The second is a proof-of-concept application that streams raw spike data and rat position data from the hard disk, performs source separation based on previously-determined waveform discrimation criteria, builds place field models, and performs the Bayesian inference to reveal sequence encoding, all in realtime.

The first system was written in a mix of c++ and Python, where data acquisition, signal processing, and networking are well-understood problems. The realtime decoding system presented more interesting challenges, in terms modeling place fields, supporting infinite data streams, and concurrency. For this system, we turned to Haskell \cite{jones2003haskell}, a language optimized for ease of building composable abstractions \cite{hughes1989functional}, through the marriage of a highly extensible static type system and functional purity. Haskell's type system enables the programmer to build custom times that capture the much of the intent of a model or algorithm, allowing the large classes of bugs to be eliminated by the compiler. Functional purity is an engineering discipline strictly enforced by Haskell that forbids variables to change their values during program execution. This restriction, thought apparently limiting, has many highly favorable consequences for managing complexity. These features fit together exceptionally well for designing highly concurrent programs, a notoriously difficult task in all programming languages \cite{jones2001tackling,harris2005composable}.

We describe the implementation of the basic acquisition system and realtime decoder, and outline a path for integrating the realtime tracking of rat position and source automated spike source localization components that will be needed to actaully conduct experiments.

\subsection*{Backend signal processing and data networking}
Raw data is aquired simultaneously, at 32kHz, from 32 channels simultaneously on 2 NI PCI-6259 analog-to-digital converter cards (National Instruments), using the NIDaqMX c API. After passing data from the driver's memory to our program, samples are written into a circular buffer and passed through a 4th order Butterworth IIR filter. This choice of filter requires only two samples of history per channel, imposing a very short delay (< 1ms) between the collection of a given sample and subsequent processing. Spikes are detected by comparing each sample to a threshold, noting threshold crossings, and then waiting for one or a few cycles of acquisition until enough samples have been collected to meet the waveform length required by the user. Parameters like filter properties, spike threshold, and spike waveform length are initially set in a configuration file, and later modified through a networked API, so that the program can be run without an immediate graphical user interface - this is a preferable arrangement for a parallel, potentially distributed system, in which we may want a single command issued by the user to affect recording systems running on multiple computers.

\subsection*{Interoperability}
Our previous recording system (AD. M.A.W. 1998 TODO date, cite?) also ran as a distributed collection of low-end acquisition computers receiving analog signals as input. In order to compare the recording quality and timing of our new system to the old system, we physically split sets of four analog inputs to two separat amplifiers - one serving each recording system. AD relies on hardware filtering of broadband data into the spike waveform band (300-6000 Hz) by a 3rd order Butterworth filter. ArtE reduces the hardware system requirements by digitally filtering a single broadband input into two signal bands - the spike band and the local field potential band (0.1 - 475 Hz), in each case using a digital filter designed to mirror the properites of AD's analog filters. Finally, using both systems in tandem required careful timebase coordination. Using standard computer system clocks is completely inadequate, as network delays between computers are on the order of several miliseconds, and can vary depending on system load. Instead, we route a diginal clock signal used to synchronize the AD computers into the ArtE system, and manually issue a counter resetting command to ArtE over the network while AD does the same for its own synchroization process. This fairly hard-coded timebase integration is one problem that will have to be solved before ArtE can be used in isolatoin from AD, but not a very difficult one.

Isolated spike waveforms as well as downsampled, continuous local field potential signals are saved to disk in a different format from the one used in the rest of our cluster-cutting and analysis workflow. Until these tools are rewritten to work with the ArtE data format, we convert ArtE files into AD format.
