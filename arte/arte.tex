\section*{Abstract}
Phenomenological descriptions of hippocampal encoding have outpaced our understanding of their underlying mechanisms and ties to learning. Distinct representations are expressed by the same cells in the same circuits, making them impossible to target using traditional molecular methods.  Some disruption specificity can be achieved by leveraging known statistical relationships between information content and the recency of spatial experience, and such experiments have provided the first evidence of a link between sequence replay and learning.  But this method stops short of being able to distinguish among the diverse forms of spatial content known to be expressed in a single recording session.
A method of decoding spatial information content in realtime is needed. To do this, we developed a multi-tetrode recording system focused on streaming representations of the processing stages typically used for offline spatial decoding: spike detection, neural source separation (cluster-cutting), position tracking, tuning curve extraction, and Bayesian stimulus reconstruction.  Our implementation makes critical use of Haskell, a programming language that aides software development by strictly separating a program's logic from its effects on program state, greatly simplifying code and eliminating large classes of common software bugs.  We describe the capabilities and limits of our recording system, its implementation, and routes for contributers to add functionality; and we survey the classes of questions that could benefit from real-time stimulus reconstruction and feedback.
