+ Abstract

Points to hit:
  + Project goal, reason for the software
  + Mid-sized ecosystem of custom programs & formats; multiple processing stages
  + Old code written in c, hard to extend
  + Speed in prototyping / experimenting
  + Application in not-very-Haskellish domain (realtime data analysis)
  + Ability to self-teach, given state of tutorials and documentation
  + Ease of concurrency (as opposed to the c code, which stalled the project)
  + Haskell gives exposure to deeper ideas in CS
  + Occasional difficulty with out-dated documentation, brocken Haddocks in hackagedb, and frustration over GUI support.
