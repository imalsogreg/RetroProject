<p>Explaining an alrogithm to another person is a very different thing from explaining an alrogithm to (or, programming) a computer.  The impedance mismatch between natural language and code means that most code (even code written by professional programmers), is chock-full of bugs.  It's useful to keep two categories in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Syntax errors</em>, <em>compile-time bugs</em>, or <em>shallow bugs</em> - these bugs come from things like spelling mistakes, forgetting to match paretheses, or using a number where a string was expected.  Annoyingly, they prevent your program from running, but you should prefer them over the next category.</li>
<li><em>Silent bugs</em>, or <em>semantic errors</em> - these bugs don't stop your program from running; they simply produce an incorrect result, which could be very bad if it goes unnoticed until after your paper is published!</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's focus our attention on the more serious of the two.</p>
