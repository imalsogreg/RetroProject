yolanda: Can't quite understand the notes about CA1/CA3.
See 120711. The LFP chanlabels seem to match expected CA1-looking or CA3-looking LFP., and are spatially divided in the hippocampus the right way. But I can't understand the mapping between LFP channels and amps a1 a2, b1 b2, etc...
121111, the colors don't seem to match at all which LFP comes from which area, and in general it's hard to see hippocampal features. Theta is there, but no ripples?

121211 - Can't find the p file.

112511 - Pretty nice. LFP labeling looks good, minus 1 or 2 oddballs. Loads of cells.

 yolanda (CA1-CA3 / CA1-long?). 
  120711 (trode_groups looks good here for most channels)
