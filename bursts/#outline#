<H2>Hippocampal Ripple Rhythmicity Entrains Cortical Activity in Slow Wave Sleep</H2>

## Abstract

## Intro

 * Ripples occur in bursts during sleep, and during long replay (Tom/Fab)
 * Cortico-hippocampal interactions (ripple/spindle) coordinated on
   seconds-timescale, not tightly coordinated.
 * No known mechanism for chaining of ripples, for ineraction w/ cortex

## Materials

 * Standard Wilson-lab recordings
 * Sort ripples into singlets, doublets; IRI distributions
 * Ripple to point process - rhythmic?
 * Ripple-triggered RSC
 * Ripple-RSC MUA examples (with 0-max yaxis scaling)
 * Anatomical distribution of RSC MUA's responding to ripples

## Results

 *
