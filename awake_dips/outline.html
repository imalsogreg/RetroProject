<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ripple-frame coordination maybe important for memory</li>
<li>During reward, RSC has slow-waves</li>
<li>Wake slow waves resemble sleep in terms of LFP shape, spindles, MUA down-states</li>
<li>Wake slow waves differ in RSC-specificity</li>
<li>SWW comes with large reward, immediately, whether sleep deprived or not.</li>
<li>Ripples &amp; replay come with SWW, correlated at behavioral timescale</li>
<li>SWS-like activity in RSC and HPC at same time are part of circuit-level offline state, maybe useful for same reason as sleep considered useful</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="relationship-to-tononis-local-sleep">Relationship to Tononi's local sleep</h3>
<ul>
<li>SWW doesn't involve entire brain</li>
<li>SWW has extended frames and dips, not just a single cycle</li>
<li>Behavioral state dependence of SWW</li>
<li>SWW doesn't rely on sleep deprivation</li>
<li>Either SWW is a different phenomenon, or Tononi real local-sleep is more specific than the Tononi paper shows.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="future-directions">Future Directions</h3>
<ul>
<li>What other brain areas coordinate with hippocampus during offline processing</li>
<li>What triggers the transition between cortical online and SWW mode?</li>
<li>What is the spatial content of SWW frames? As in Ji, is it related to hippocampal content?</li>
