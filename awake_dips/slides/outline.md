Lab meeting
===========

Retrosplenial/Hippocampal Coordination
--------------------------------------

* Matrix
  * Rows:
    - Awake light-sleep-like
    - Awake deep-like
    - LightSWS
    - DeepSWS
  * Cols: 
    - # of ripples
    - Percentage doublet, triplet, quad
    - ripple amplitude
    - ripple frequency
    - burst snd ripple amplitude / burst fst ripple amplitude

* Dip-triggered RSC MUA/LFP
* Dip-triggered RSC MUA/LFP breakdown by tetrode

* Dip-triggered HPC Ripple
* Dip-triggered HPC LFP/MUA
* DIP-triggered HPC LFP/MUA breakdown by tetrode

* Do these analysis in the Sprague-Dawley rat, too


Haskell, arte
-------------

* Intro to FP & Haskell usefullness abstraction
* Explanation of effects in pure language

* Overview of haskell-tetrode-ephys types

* Overview of spike-sorting code


* Demo reading from file, possibly place cells forming, maybe decoding
