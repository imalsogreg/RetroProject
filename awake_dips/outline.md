## Title

### See [title.md](title.md)

## Abstract



## Intro




## Materials

 * 30tt drives with pattern of guide tubes targeting 3 areas
 * Drive, surgery, adjusting done as previously reported
 

## Results

### Figure 1 (Sleep slow waves)
 * Example rasters, LFP
 * Distribution of MUA RSC firing rates during SWS
 * In sleep, characterization of frame lengths, dip lengths, K-complexes

### Figure 2 (Wake slow waves)
 * Example RSC LFPs and rasters during slow waves
 * Distribution of dip times, dip amplitudes.  Comparison of awake 'frames' to sleep frames (are they as spikey?)

### Figure 3 (Relationship to Hippocampus, ripples, replay)
 * 5-second window of (HPC & RSC) (MUA & LFP), showing how we detect ripples and   frames
 * Overlay dips/frames on hippocampal reconstruction, to show that this is the offline processing period
 * 200-second window showing the behavioral-timescale relationship
 * During run, xcorr between ripples and frames as a function of time smoothing
 * Same ripple-frame relationship during SWS

### Figure 4 (Timing relationship to early learning or long reward periods)
 * imagesc plot: 
  - x-axis is time (sec) since stopping, 
  - y-axis lap number (neighboring days stacked on top of one another
  - c-axis likelihood of a dip
 * This plot, using only small rewards, can show the novelty effect
 * Same plot but for big rewards, shows override of novelty by huge food

### Figure 5 (Restriction to RSC)
 * Wake slow wave rasters in RSC, somato, motor
 * Anatomical map of MUA activity during Wake, triggered on frame starts (perhaps sorted by dip lengths or frame lengths)
 * Same map during sleep, showing coordination of all cortical areas

### Figure 6 (Independence of time of day, sleepiness)
 * Examples of dips/frames during dark-cycle running
 * Examples during EMG activity and chewing

## Discussion

### Summary
 * HPC offline processing mode coordinates w/ SW's restricted to RSC
 * RSC slow waves occur in the same processing state, but not neural timescale
 * Prevalence of SW's changes with prolonged exposure to task

### Slow-Wave Wake
 * Similarity of brain activity during consumption to SWS state - Interesting!
 * Differences (Non-involvement of somato and motor cortex) - Also interesting
 * Advance in understanding of 'offline processing state' previously thought to involve just hippocampus.

### Relationship to Tononi's local sleep
 * SWW doesn't involve entire brain
 * SWW has extended frames and dips, not just a single cycle
 * Behavioral state dependence of SWW
 * SWW doesn't rely on sleep deprivation
 * Either SWW is a different phenomenon, or Tononi real local-sleep is more specific than the Tononi paper shows.
