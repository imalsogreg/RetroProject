% Outline: Hippocampal coding under time constraints
% Gregory Hale

Overview
========

Three chapters about populations of neurons in the hippocampus coordinating their activity on very fine timescales, and how that coordination relates to the larger context of inputs and readouts. In the first chapter, explore the lack of synchrony in timing of the brain rhythms underlying excitatory drive in hippocampal place cells, and the impact of those differences on the ability of distant place cells to coordinate reliably during population-wide coding events. In the second chapter, describe the development of a tool for detecting place cell population coding events and using the information they contain to manipulate brain activity in an experimental way. In the third chapter, describe the unexpected transition of retrosplenial cortex into a slow-wave-sleep like state during reward consumption, and the timing relationship between hippocampal activity and retrosplenial cortex during these events.
