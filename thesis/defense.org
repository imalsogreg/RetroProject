** Timing of hippocampal cortical sleep rhythms, during wake
** A new tool for responding to ensemble coding in real time

* Synchronized information in a desynchronized circuit
** Theta oscillations, timing offsets
** Theta sequences
** Position decoding, regional offsets
** Follow-up: pairwise time offsets
** Interpretation

* Retrosplenial cortex slow-wave wake
** Slow-wave sleep, frames, and HPC-CTX interactions
** RSC exhibits SWS-like behavior during rewards
** SWW coordinates with HPC
** SWW appearance under diverse conditions
** SWW anatomical restriction
** Interpretation

* Real time position decoding
** Hippocampal replay
** Real time experiments
** Position decoding
** Real time decoding challenges
** Concurrency
** Haskell
** Real time demo
** Example decodings
** Bugs, deadlocks, crashes, and performance debugging
** Sketching a full real time decoding system
