I. Ripple timing
- Motivation: 
 - Rhythmicity as a mechanistic clue
 - Rhythmic communication
 - Bursts - special forms of ripples?  Bursts more communicative than single ripples?

OOO- Examples of ripple-detection, doublets, tripplets
OOO - During run
OOO - During sleep
OOO - Overview

OOO- Average ripple power triggered on singlets, doublets, tripplets
OOO - During run
OOO - During sleep

OOO- Rhythmicity
OOO - Align bursts on central ripple 

OOO- Average Hippocampal MUA triggered on singlets, doublets, tripplets
OOO - During run
OOO - During sleep

OOO- MUA in RSC during singlets, doublets, tripplets
OOO - During run
